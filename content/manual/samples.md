Let\'s go a little deeper into how you can modify and tune your samples
in NitrousTracker. Start off by tapping the sample tab. Then, tap the
microphone and [record something](../loadsamples).

To cut off silence in the beginning and the end, select the part you
want to cut off and press the delete button.

If your sample is too quiet, you can simply increase the volume. Press
the normalize button, then increase the ampilitude value and press ok.

If your sample starts or ends too abruptly, you can use the fade
feature. Just select the region that you want to fade and press the fade
in or fade out button.

## Looping

To make a sample go on forever, you can make it play in a loop. There
are two types of loops: forward and ping-pong loops. Forward loops just
play back the selected part of the sample again and again, while ping
pong loops play back the part forward and backward. This usually makes
loops smoother and avoids clicking when playback is continued at the
beginning of the loop.

To add a loop, go to the sample tab, and then to the loop tab below the
sample viewer.

Select forward and you\'ll see two markers appear, marking the beginning
and the end of the loop. Move the markers and listen to your sample to
find a loop that sounds good. Select ping-pong to hear how it changes
the sound.

NitrousTracker automatically tries to avoid clicking loops by moving the
loop points to the closest zero crossing. You can turn this off by
un-checking the snap checkbox.

## Tuning

In the tuning tab, there\'s a bunch of values you can tweak to tune your
sample.

* **vol** changes the sample volume
* **pan** pans the sample between the left and right speaker
* **rel** selects the relative note of the sample (see below)
* **tune** finetunes the sample pitch up or down

An often misunderstood (and admittedly quite idiotic) concept is the
relative note. I didn\'t invent it, so don\'t blame me! NitrousTracker
assumes that whatever sample you load or record corresponds to the note
C. Of course often this won\'t be the case, especially for recorded
samples. To fix this, use the relative note note setting. This setting
specifies the note that is mapped to the C-4 key on the keyboard. Play
around with relative note and finetune until the C-4 key corresponds to
the note C-4.

It\'s also possible to save your samples as wav files. Just go to the
disk tab, select smp, enter a name for the sample and press save.

That\'s all there is to samples in NitrousTracker. But since samples are
only the building blocks for instruments, it\'s also important to know
how to use the instrument settings, which is going to be covered in the
next section.
