## Disclaimer

NitrousTracker is still beta software. Therefore, bugs exist. As long as I
have been playing with it now, it has behaved rather nicely. It has
neither destroyed my memory card nor my DS. Anyway, if this happens to
you, I won\'t take responsibility, i.e. you use NitrousTracker at your own
risk!

## About bugs

If you find a bug, try to reproduce it. Then post the steps for
reproduction in the [NitrousTracker issue tracker](https://github.com/NitrousTracker/nitroustracker/issues)
Before you post, check if it isn\'t a duplicate of an already posted
bug! Plase include all information you can provide on the bug, if
necessary including the song/sample that causes it.

## Important precautions

In seldom cases, it may happen that NitroTracker corrups your card and
you loose all your songs. To prevent this, you should follow this
important rule:

**Save early, save often!**

Also:

**Regularly scan your card with scandisk or fsck!**

The list of known issues / problems I\'m working on can be found in the
[NitrousTracker issue tracker](https://github.com/NitrousTracker/nitroustracker/issues).
