## Further reading

If you have never touched a tracker before and if if you have read all
of the above, you should know how to use NitrousTracker, but you should
still know very little about tracking. To learn how to track, you should
use THE INTARWEB! Besides googling, I would recommend reading:

* [The Trackers Handbook](https://web.archive.org/web/20150205173143/http://www.modplug.com/mods/handbook/handbook.htm)
* [Articles on United-Trackers](https://web.archive.org/web/20150205173143/http://www.united-trackers.org/forum/index.php/board,20.0.html), especially
    * [The Process of Learning to Track](https://web.archive.org/web/20150205173143/http://www.united-trackers.org/forum/index.php/topic,256.0.html),
    * and for some more advances techniques, read [Techniques of chipping](https://www.milkytracker.org/docs/Vhiiula-TechniquesOfChipping.txt).

Also, stop by at the [NitrousTracker forum](http://modarchive.org/forums/index.php?board=79.0)
if you have any questions about, or feedback on NitrousTracker, if you
want to share your work, or if you just want to get in touch with other
users. Alternatively, visit the [unofficial Discord community](https://discord.gg/KdWJZHtGAU),
operated by deadpahn.

Otherwise, all that\'s left to say is: **Be creative and have fun!**

NitroTracker is built on the hard work of a lot of people
who work on DS homebrew mostly in their spare time. This
list is by nomeans comprehensive, so please don't sue me
if you are missing your name here :-)

* chishm for the universal FAT library
* sgstair for the incredible wifi lib
* Headspin for the great on-screen typewriter design
* doublec for his ds development tutorials that got me started with DS coding
* Martin Korth for the incredible gbatek reference and the no$gba emulator
* My friends in `#dsdev` for patiently answering my questions
* starpause for providing the samples used in the tutorial
* Michael Krause for the open source SoundTracker, that was a great help with the XM format
* Last but not least: Vogue and Mr.H of Triton for Fasttracker II, the tracker that NitroTracker was designed after.
