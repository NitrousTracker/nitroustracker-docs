## Further reading

If you have never touched a tracker before and if if you have read all
of the above, you should know how to use NitrousTracker, but you should
still know very little about tracking. To learn how to track, you should
use THE INTARWEB! Besides googling, I would recommend reading:

* [The Trackers Handbook](https://web.archive.org/web/20150205173143/http://www.modplug.com/mods/handbook/handbook.htm)
* [Articles on United-Trackers](https://web.archive.org/web/20150205173143/http://www.united-trackers.org/forum/index.php/board,20.0.html), especially
    * [The Process of Learning to Track](https://web.archive.org/web/20150205173143/http://www.united-trackers.org/forum/index.php/topic,256.0.html),
    * and for some more advances techniques, read [Techniques of chipping](https://www.milkytracker.org/docs/Vhiiula-TechniquesOfChipping.txt).

Also, stop by at the [NitrousTracker forum](http://modarchive.org/forums/index.php?board=79.0)
if you have any questions about, or feedback on NitrousTracker, if you
want to share your work, or if you just want to get in touch with other
users. Alternatively, visit the [unofficial Discord community](https://discord.gg/KdWJZHtGAU),
operated by deadpahn.

Otherwise, all that\'s left to say is: **Be creative and have fun!**
